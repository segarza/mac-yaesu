# mac-yaesu
Bash script to identify correct Yaesu Radio device file on macOS (/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART)

This script was created to address the annoying task of identifying the correct /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUARTx for Yaesu FT-891 & FT-991A radios attached to a Mac running macOS Monterrey. This values often change across reboots.
This script requires Hamlib to be installed on the system. Hamlib can be easily installed using hombrew (https://brew.sh): brew install hamlib

 
If flrig is installed and enabled (see user configurable settings), the script will launch an instance per radio. 
flrig must have been manually launched and initially configured once per radio prior to enabling flrig in the user configurable settings. 
To manually launch flrigâ€“ Open terminal and type: open -a /Applications/flrig.app --args --config-dir ~/Documents/Yaesu/891 (or 991A)
The folders ~/Documents/Yaesu/891 & ~/Documents/Yaesu/991A must be manually created by the user prior to running the above command.

flrig can also be installed with hombrew: brew install --cask flrig

When enabled, the script will launch rigctld instance per radio.
